# Web3.Storage example-image-gallery

This is an example of using [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage) to create a simple image gallery that can be shared with your friends using decentralized web tech like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io).

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Run the dev server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

On the first run, you'll be redirected to http://localhost:3000/settings.html to paste in an API token. If you don't have a token yet, see the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.web3.storage/) to learn how to get one.
The token is saved to your browser's local storage, so you should only need to do this once.
